### Database Design

**Notes**:
all tables below might have an `id`, `created_at`, `updated_at` according to the need, this diagram is only a rough estimate based on the provided details but can be extended or modified based on more details or future increment optimizations

- **users**
    - `name`
    - `email`
    - `password`

- **posts**
    - `body`
    - `user_id` (foreign to users table)
    - `feed_context_id` (polymorphic to `groups` or `events` table, nullable if meant to be published on user profile)
    - `feed_context_type` (`App\Models\Group` or `App\Models\Event`, nullable if meant to be published on user profile)

- **comments**
    - `body`
    - `user_id` (foreign to users table)
    - `post_id` (foreign to posts table)

- **reactions**
    - `type` (Enum : Love, Sad, Laugh ...)
    - `user_id` (foreign to users table)
    - `post_id` (foreign to posts table)

- **attachments**
    - `type` (Enum : Link, File)
    - `file_path` (nullable if the type if link)
    - `preview_file_path` (nullable if the type if link)
    - `preview_url` (this will hold the link url if the type is link, however if the type is file it will hold a preview url for a small dimensions image or video that was generated when uploading for a quick preview instead of loading the full file )
    - `attachable_id` (polymorphic to `posts` or `comments` table)
    - `attachable_type` (`App\Models\Post` or `App\Models\Comment`)

- **groups**
    - `name`
    - `description`

- **events**
    - `name`
    - `description`
    - `date`
    - `location`

- **subscriptions**
    - `user_id` (foreign to users table)
    - `subscribable_id` (polymorphic to `groups` or `events` table)
    - `subscribable_type` (`App\Models\Group` or `App\Models\Event`)
    - `type` (Enum : Admin, Member)

- **followers**
    - `follower_id` (foreign to users table)
    - `following_id` (foreign to users table)

### API Routes

- `POST /posts` : Create a new post
- `GET /posts/{id}` : Retrieve a specific post
- `PUT /posts/{id}` : Update an existing post
- `DELETE /posts/{id}` : Delete a post
- `POST /posts/{post_id}/comments` : Add a comment to a post
- `DELETE /comments/{id}` : Delete a comment
- `POST /posts/{post_id}/reactions` : Add a reaction to a post
- `DELETE /reactions/{id}` : Delete a reaction
- `POST /attachments` : Upload a file or link as an attachment
- `GET /feed` : Retrieve the userâ€™s home feed (followings & groups & events posts)
- `GET /users/{id}/feed` : Retrieve the user profile feed
- `GET /groups/{id}/feed` : Retrieve the group feed
- `GET /events/{id}/feed` : Retrieve the event feed
- `GET /link-preview` : Fetch metadata for a link
- `POST /followers` : Add the authenticated user as a follower to the specified user
- `DELETE /followers` : Delete the authenticated user from the followers list of the specifed user
- `POST /subscriptions` : Add the authenticated user as a subscriber to the specified group or event
- `DELETE /subscriptions/{id}` : Delete the subscription

### Description

- **Performance considerations for handling feeds** : we could use an advanced join query to retrieve user home feed, or we can go a step further and cache the feeds in the database in a way which when the post is created we determine the correponding users that we should show the post to based on the subscriptions and followers, and this feed can be saved in a separate database table (e.g., `feeds (user_id, post_id)`)
- **File storage scalability** : we may want to use a dedicated file storage service such as aws s3 for a reliable storage solution (backup, latency, region availability)
- For the translations we can go either the manual way and give the user the possiblity to set his post in different languages, tho this seems like a cumbersome process for the user so we might as well just rely on translation services like Google Translation or DeepL to deligate the translation process
- We should be aware of some of the security concerns regarding file uploads, including size limits and malicious file detection and private files hosting to ensure the privacy of post's attachments.
